## 🌍 Connecting to local node

Harness the Portal's power to connect to your [local zkSync Era node](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/testing/).

**Prerequisites:** Node.js version 16+, npm version 7+

1. 📚 Follow the [documentation](https://era.zksync.io/docs/tools/testing/) for setting up either an **in-memory node** or **dockerized local setup**.
2. 🔄 Clone the Portal repository and set it up:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/dapp-portal.git
    cd dapp-portal
    npm install
    ```
3. 🛠️ Modify the default network settings in `data/networks.ts` if your network ID, RPC URL, or other info differs. Customize displayed tokens there if needed.
    - Alternatively, use the [configuration form](./hyperchains/README.md#configure-automatically-with-form) for guided config setup.
4. 🔥 Launch the dev server:
    - For in-memory node:
      ```bash
      npm run dev:node:memory
      ```
    - For dockerized setup:
      ```bash
      npm run dev:node:docker
      ```
  Navigate to the displayed Portal URL (typically http://localhost:3000).

## 🛠 Development

### Advanced configuration

#### L1 Balances:
By default, L1 balances are fetched via a public RPC. For faster loading speeds and reduced load on your L1 RPC provider, consider using [Ankr's RPC service](https://www.ankr.com/rpc/). Obtain an Ankr token and update the `.env` file:
```bash
ANKR_TOKEN=your_ankr_token_here
```

#### Wallet Connect Project Setup:
Before deploying your own version of the Portal, ensure you create your own Wallet Connect project on [walletconnect.com](https://walletconnect.com). After creating the project, update the project ID in the `.env` file:
```bash
WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```


### 🔧 Setup

Ensure you've installed the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 🌐 Development Server

Activate the dev server at http://localhost:3000:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 🏭 Production

Compile for production:

```bash
npm run generate
```
